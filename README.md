# SQL Data Exploration with COVID-19 Dataset

## Overview 
Using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, a COVID-19 dataset was explored to analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccination rates between countries and continents over time. A significant portion of the project was completed following Alex the Analyst's SQL tutorial on Youtube; addional modifications and customizations were made and clearly labeled in the comments of the SQL script. 

## Dataset 
- **Source**: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)
- **Key Features**:
  - Location, Date, New Cases, Total Cases, New Deaths, Total Deaths, New Vaccinations, Total Vaccinations

## Tools Used
- SQL
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

## Process
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Imported the dataset into SQL Server. Two different databases were created from one dataset for SQL showcasing. 
2. **Analysis**:
   - Used SQL queries to identify trends and aggregated metrics.
3. **Documentation**:
   - Oragnaized the SQL statments. Commented the purpose of the statements and specfic features used.
